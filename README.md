# Pure Data patch for Experiments in Living artwork 

## Important

Make sure `listener.pd` and `websocket-server.pd` are in the same folders. `listener-dev.pd` is just for local testing without live input. 

This repo is the definitive version for the live artwork.

## Notes
The audio files are just for use with `listener-dev.pd`.
